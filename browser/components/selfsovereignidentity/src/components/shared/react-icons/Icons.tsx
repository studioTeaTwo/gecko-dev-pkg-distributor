// documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
// within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
// wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
// of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
// do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
// notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

// that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
// as modifying the License.

// You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
// may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
// for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
// for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
// reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

// 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
// any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
// by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
// this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

// whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
// unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
// negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
// liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
// incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
// result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
// Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
// work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
// other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
// has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

// 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
// the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
// and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
// or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
// License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

// of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
// defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
// incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
// of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
